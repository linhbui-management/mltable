[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/linhbui-management/mltable.svg?token=4VKpm7KznzmjKM9vcLMv&branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/linhbui-management/mltable)

This R package provides tools for calculating and formatting correlation matrices for Level 1 and Level 2 data. 
It includes additional metrics such as mean, standard deviation, Cronbach's alpha, and rwg.j.

# Installation
To install the package, use the following commands in R:

## Install the devtools package if you don't already have it
# Installation Instructions

To install the `devtools` package, use the following command:

install.packages("devtools")

## Install the package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("linhbui.management/mltable")

# Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the package:

library(mltable)

## Level 1 Correlation Matrix (e.g., individual level)
data <- teamstate
var_list <- list(
    var1 = 3,
    var2 = 4,
    var3 = 5:14,
    var4 = 15:24,
    var5 = 25:28)

  result <- corr_level1(data,
                        var_list,
                        var_labels = c("Gender", "Age", "Positive Affect",
                                        "Negative Affect", "Psychological Safety"))

print(result)>
## Level 2 Correlation Matrix (e.g., group level)
# Example usage
data <- teamstate
var_list2 <- list(
                  var1 = 5:14,
                  var2 = 15:24,
                  var3 = 25:28)

result <- corr_level2(data = teamstate,
                      var_list = var_list2,
                      groupid = "Team",
                      var_labels = c("Team PA", "Team NA", "Team Psychological Safety"),
                      rwg_scale = 7)

print(result)
