# mltable - Calculating and Formatting Tables for Multilevel Data <img src="logo_mltable.png" align="right" width="220"/>

The 'mltable' package provides tools for generating descriptive statistics tables 
and correlation matrices for multilevel data. It includes functions for calculating 
level-1 and level-2 correlations, aggregating data by groups, and computing 
additional statistics such as means, standard deviations, Cronbach's alpha, and 
RWG(J). These functions are particularly useful for researchers working with 
hierarchical or nested data structures, such as teams, organizations, or repeated 
measures. 

The package simplifies the process of analyzing and reporting multilevel 
data by automating the creation of publication-ready tables.
    
# Installation
To install the package, use the following commands in R:

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("linhbui.management/mltable")
```
# Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the package:


## Level 1 Correlation Matrix (e.g., individual level)

```r
library(mltable)
data <- teamstate
var_list <- list(
    var1 = 3,
    var2 = 4,
    var3 = 5:14,
    var4 = 15:24,
    var5 = 25:28)

  result <- corr_level1(data,
                        var_list,
                        var_labels = c("Gender", "Age", "Positive Affect",
                                        "Negative Affect", "Psychological Safety"))

print(result)>
```

## Level 2 Correlation Matrix (e.g., group level)

```r
data <- teamstate
var_list2 <- list(
                  var1 = 5:14,
                  var2 = 15:24,
                  var3 = 25:28)

result <- corr_level2(data = teamstate,
                      var_list = var_list2,
                      groupid = "Team",
                      var_labels = c("Team PA", "Team NA", "Team Psychological Safety"),
                      rwg_scale = 7)

print(result)
```
