Description: 
    The 'mltable' package provides tools for generating descriptive statistics tables 
    and correlation matrices for multilevel data. It includes functions for calculating 
    level-1 and level-2 correlations, aggregating data by groups, and computing 
    additional statistics such as means, standard deviations, Cronbach's alpha, and 
    RWG(J). These functions are particularly useful for researchers working with 
    hierarchical or nested data structures, such as teams, organizations, or repeated 
    measures. The package simplifies the process of analyzing and reporting multilevel 
    data by automating the creation of publication-ready tables.
